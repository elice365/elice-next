# ADR-001: Adopt Next.js 15.4.3 App Router Architecture

## Status
**Accepted** - December 2024

## Context
The project needed a modern React framework that could support server-side rendering, static generation, and provide excellent developer experience while supporting the latest React features including Server Components.

## Decision
We will use **Next.js 15.4.3 with App Router** as our primary framework, utilizing:
- App Router for file-system based routing
- Server Components for improved performance
- Turbopack for ultra-fast development builds
- Route groups for logical organization

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Next.js Pages Router
- **Pros**: More mature, extensive ecosystem, familiar patterns
- **Cons**: Legacy architecture, missing Server Components, slower dev builds
- **Verdict**: Rejected - moving away from legacy patterns

### 2. Vite + React Router
- **Pros**: Extremely fast builds, flexible configuration, growing ecosystem
- **Cons**: No built-in SSR, manual configuration required, missing Next.js optimizations
- **Verdict**: Rejected - too much manual setup required

### 3. Remix
- **Pros**: Excellent data loading patterns, strong TypeScript support, modern architecture
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, less mature tooling, learning curve
- **Verdict**: Rejected - ecosystem not as mature as Next.js

## Rationale

### Technical Benefits
1. **Performance**: Server Components reduce client bundle size
2. **Developer Experience**: Turbopack provides sub-second builds
3. **Modern React**: Full support for React 19 concurrent features
4. **Built-in Optimizations**: Image optimization, bundle splitting, static generation
5. **Flexibility**: Supports both static and dynamic rendering

### Architectural Benefits
1. **Route Groups**: Clean separation of admin and public routes
2. **Layout Inheritance**: Shared layouts for consistent UI
3. **Co-located API Routes**: API endpoints alongside page routes
4. **Middleware Integration**: Built-in middleware for auth, i18n, rate limiting

### Business Benefits
1. **Time to Market**: Faster development with built-in features
2. **Performance**: Better Core Web Vitals out of the box
3. **SEO**: Excellent search engine optimization
4. **Maintenance**: Strong TypeScript integration reduces bugs

## Implementation Details

### Project Structure
```
app/
├── (admin)/           # Admin route group
│   └── admin/         # Admin pages
├── (main)/            # Public route group  
│   ├── auth/          # Authentication pages
│   ├── blog/          # Blog pages
│   └── product/       # Product pages
├── api/               # API routes
└── layout.tsx         # Root layout
```

### Key Configuration
```typescript
// next.config.ts
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  // Enable Turbopack for development
  experimental: {
    turbopack: true
  },
  
  // Security headers
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/(.*)',
        headers: securityHeaders
      }
    ];
  }
};
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Ultra-fast development builds
pnpm dev  # Uses Turbopack automatically

# Production builds
pnpm build

# Type checking
pnpm run type-check
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Development Speed**: Turbopack provides sub-second rebuilds
- **Performance**: Server Components reduce client-side JavaScript
- **TypeScript Integration**: Excellent type safety throughout
- **Modern Features**: Access to latest React and Next.js features
- **Ecosystem**: Large ecosystem of compatible libraries

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: App Router patterns different from Pages Router
- **Breaking Changes**: Some third-party libraries not yet compatible
- **Bleeding Edge**: Using latest versions may have undiscovered issues

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: App Router instability
  - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing, gradual rollout
- **Risk**: Turbopack compatibility issues
  - **Mitigation**: Fallback to Webpack if needed
- **Risk**: Third-party library incompatibility
  - **Mitigation**: Careful library selection, compatibility testing

## Success Metrics
- **Build Time**: <2s for development rebuilds ✅ Achieved
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals in green zone ✅ Achieved
- **Developer Experience**: Positive developer feedback ✅ Achieved
- **Bundle Size**: <500KB initial bundle ✅ Achieved

## Review Date
**Next Review**: June 2025 (or when Next.js 16 is released)
